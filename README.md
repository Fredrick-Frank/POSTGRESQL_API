# POSTGRESQL_API
This practical project used the postgresql database and nodejs for building a CRUD http method.
The followwing steps was taken to build a server side API:
* NPM library such as:
--- npm init -y
--- npm i express pg(postgre library)
--- npm i -D nodemon (dev dependecies)
--- npm run dev for auto-restarting the application

Database Function: 
\l: listing all the database in pg
\c: move data inside the database 
\dt: show table database


Creating user:
psql -u postgre
